			<p> Scarlett is an interpreter for a language that is inspired on Kernel/Scheme.
			I aim to stay close to John Shutt's Kernel as presented in the 
			<a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html">R<sup>-1</sup>RK</a>
			combined with the newest Scheme standard
			<a href="http://www.r6rs.org">R<sup>6</sup>RS</a>.
			However, I don't consider these documents to be holy, even though the design
			principles followed in the R<sup>-1</sup>RK are very good.
			The interpreter is developed in portable C++ (2011 standard). The aim is to provide
			an easy extension language to C++, with transparent support for numerical arrays
			in the tradition of Python with NumPy.</p>

			<p> Performance in terms of speed is not a primary target. The idea is to have
			all underlying structures and operators defined in C++; Scarlett providing
			the means of putting different elements together.

				<li> implementing numerical tower
				<li> universal lists
				<li> continuation guards

			<p> Scarlett fits into a long history of Lisp variants like Scheme and Kernel. If you
			are not familiar with either Lisp or Scheme, I recommend to learn Scheme from the lectures
			by 
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">
					Abelson and Sussman -- "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"</a>
			</ul>
			as well as 
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992">
					Friedman and Felleisen -- "the Little Schemer" and "the Seasoned Schemer"</a>.
			</ul>
			There are several (planned) features that deviate from the Schemes that you may know.</p>

			<h3>F-exprs</h3>
			<p>Like Kernel, we make the distinction between <i>operative</i> and <i>applicative</i>
			functions. Applicatives have their argument-tree mapped through <tt>eval</tt>, before
			being passed to the underlying operative, which applies its arguments unevaluated.
			Operatives should have name starting with <tt>$</tt> and are created using
			<tt>$vau</tt>. To create an applicative from an operative and back, the applicatives
			<tt>wrap</tt> and <tt>unwrap</tt> are defined. For example, the <tt>$lambda</tt>-operative
			can be defined as
			<pre>($define! $lambda ($vau (par-tree . body) dyn-env
    (wrap (eval (list* $vau par-tree #ignore body) dyn-env))))</pre> </p>

			<h3>Pattern matching</h3>
			<p>Scarlett supports Kernel-style formal parameter trees. This means a set of parameters
			can have more complicated topology than just a proper or improper list.
			For example, we can decompose a list into its <tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt>,
			by pattern matching:
			<pre>($define! (lcar . lcdr) [1 2 3 4])</pre>
			Resulting in <tt>lcar</tt> having value <tt>1</tt>, and
			<tt>lcdr</tt> having value <tt>(2 3 4)</tt>.
			We added some syntax candy of <tt>[items ...]</tt>, which is equivalent
			to <tt>(list items ...)</tt>, and transparent support for pair syntax,
			<tt>(func . lst)</tt> being the same as <tt>(apply func lst)</tt>.
			This means we don't need the functions <tt>cons, car, cdr, list</tt>
			or <tt>list*</tt>; eventhough they are still defined as such. A function returning
			the first 12 numbers from the Fibonacci sequence from <tt>(fib [1 1] 10)</tt>,
			can be defined as follows</p>
			<pre>($define! fib
  ($lambda ((a b . c) n)
    ($if (zero? n)
      [a b . c]
      (fib [(+ a b) a b . c] (- n 1)))))</pre>

			<p>[<b>N(Y|E)I</b>] There are some ideas that go even further. Using function overloading
			in combination with pattern matching with predicates, allows you to
			write programs in a formal way, without using <tt>$if</tt>-statements.
			This is similar, though more powerfull, to the <tt>$case-lambda</tt> construct in scheme.
			There are several complications, mainly in syntax. Do we allow the parameter-tree to be
			mixed with predicates? They would have to be predicates <i>before</i> evaluation. 
			How do we mix in type-checking into this? All in all, it seems that a simple conditional
			is just as simple, and clear as a more complicated pattern-matching. Also an <tt>$if</tt>
			statement is more efficient than matching an entire pattern.</p>

			<h3>Cyclic lists</h3>
			<p>Scarlett has build-in support for cyclic lists. A bit of extra syntax:</p>
			<pre>[1 2 3 4 ...]</pre>
			is equivalent to
			<pre>($let ((a (list 1 2 3 4))) (encycle! a 3 1) a)</pre>
			This is extremely usefull when we try to match list patterns for some function.
			For example an implementation of <tt>$let</tt>, may check its arguments 
			for congruence against
			<pre>(((:par-tree: :expr:) ...) :body:)</pre>

			<h3>Objects</h3>
			<p>Objects are very naturally implemented in Scarlett in the form of <i>closures</i>.
<pre>($define! look-up
  (wrap ($vau (s) e (eval s e))))

($define! make-object 
  ($lambda ()
    ($let ((env (current-environment)))
      ($vau (method . args) #ignore
        ($cond 
	  ((combiner? (look-up method))
	   (eval [method . args] env))

	  (#t (look-up method)))))))

($let ((A (make-object)))
  (A $define! x 7)
  (A $define! f ($lambda (y) (* x y)))
  (A f (+ 4 2)))</pre>
			Returning the value <tt>42</tt>. This example can be expanded to support class definitions 
			and inheritance. An interface to C++ objects can be implemented
			to mimic this style objects. Also this allows to implement multi-type operators like
			<tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, etc. transparently. </p>

			<h3>Universal lists (NYI)</h3>
			<p>Scheme has several linear structures: lists, vectors and streams. Each has its set of
			accessor functions. Combining different structures in a single applicative like <tt>map</tt>
			is not so easy. If we use the Scarlett object interface with C++ iterators in mind,
			it becomes feasible to define a universal lazy <tt>map</tt>. Also all these structures
			allow for a <tt>head</tt>/<tt>tail</tt> functionality, so a vector can be matched
			to a paramater-tree as easily as a stream, or user defined sequence. This feature is
			<b>N</b>ot <b>Y</b>et <b>I</b>mplemented.

			<p> The source code of Scarlett is available on
			<a href="http://github.com/jhidding/scarlett">github</a>,
			under the GPL3 licence. To download Scarlett say
			<pre>git clone https://github.com/jhidding/scarlett.git</pre>
			Compile the code using <tt>./make all</tt> in the directory
			that contains the <tt>make</tt>-script. I use C++11 extensively,
			so a version of GCC &ge; 4.7 is required.
