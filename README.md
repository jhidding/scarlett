Scarlett - a Kernel/Scheme interpreter
======================================

This is my attempt at making a interpreter for the Kernel language by
John N. Shutt. This rather new language is not unlike Scheme. The
specification of this language can be found in the file `05-07.pdf`.
The interpreter is still far from working, but the basic machinery is in
place. The goal of this project is to have a nice extension /
configuration language to my C++ projects. Performance is not an issue (yet).
